## My process

### Built with

- React
- react-loader-spinner
- react-circular-progressbar
- dayjs
- Sass
- Styled Components
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a challenge because of the many different libraries I had to add to it. I also challenged myself to use Sass alongside Styled Components to practice both styling methods. In a React project like this I believe Styled Components proved to be the better way to style the page.

### Continued development

In the future I will add a history tab using the react-calender lib.
